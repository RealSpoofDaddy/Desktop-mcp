# DesktopMCP - Desktop Automation through Model Context Protocol

DesktopMCP connects AI assistants like Claude to your desktop, enabling intelligent automation of your PC through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This integration allows AI to help you with everyday tasks like opening applications, managing files, browsing the web, and monitoring your system.

## üöÄ Features

- **Application Management**: Open and control applications like Blender, VS Code, browsers, calculators, and more
- **File Operations**: Move, copy, and organize files and directories with intelligent path handling
- **Web Automation**: Search the web, navigate to websites, and automate browser tasks
- **System Monitoring**: Get real-time system information including CPU, memory, disk usage, and running processes
- **Screenshot Capture**: Take desktop screenshots for documentation or troubleshooting
- **Command Execution**: Run system commands safely with timeout controls
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üõ† Components

The system consists of a single MCP server that provides desktop automation tools:

- **Desktop MCP Server** (`src/desktop_mcp/server.py`): A Python server implementing the Model Context Protocol with desktop automation capabilities

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- uv package manager (recommended for dependency management)

**Install uv:**

**MacOS:**
```bash
brew install uv
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
set Path=C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.local\bin;%Path%
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Claude Desktop Integration

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "desktop": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "desktop-mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Cursor Integration

For Cursor IDE integration, add to Settings > MCP:

**Global Server:**
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "desktop": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "desktop-mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

**Windows Users:** Use this configuration instead:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "desktop": {
            "command": "cmd",
            "args": [
                "/c",
                "uvx",
                "desktop-mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## üéØ Usage

Once configured, you'll see a hammer icon with desktop automation tools in Claude or Cursor. Here are some example commands you can use:

### Application Management

- "Launch VS Code with my project directory"
- "Open a web browser and navigate to GitHub"
- "Start the calculator application"

### File Operations
- "Move all my photos from Downloads to Pictures folder"
- "Copy this project folder to my backup drive"
- "Show me what's in my Documents directory"
- "Organize my desktop files by file type"

### Web Browsing
- "Search Google for Python tutorials"
- "Navigate to stackoverflow.com"
- "Open YouTube and search for Blender tutorials"

### System Monitoring
- "Show me my system's current performance stats"
- "List the programs using the most CPU"
- "Take a screenshot of my desktop"
- "Check how much disk space I have left"

### Command Execution
- "Run a git status command in my project directory"
- "Update my system packages"
- "Check my network connectivity"
