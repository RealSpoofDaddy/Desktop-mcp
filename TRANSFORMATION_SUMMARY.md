# Desktop MCP Transformation Summary

## Overview
Successfully transformed the Blender MCP into a comprehensive Desktop MCP that provides AI-powered automation for your entire PC, not just Blender.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Project Structure
- **Renamed**: `blender-mcp` → `desktop-mcp`
- **Module**: `src/blender_mcp/` → `src/desktop_mcp/`
- **Entry point**: `blender-mcp` → `desktop-mcp`

### 2. Dependencies Updated
**Added new dependencies for desktop automation:**
- `psutil>=5.9.0` - System monitoring and process management
- `requests>=2.31.0` - HTTP requests for web operations
- `pillow>=10.0.0` - Image processing for screenshots
- `pyautogui>=0.9.54` - Screen capture and GUI automation
- `selenium>=4.15.0` - Web browser automation
- `webdriver-manager>=4.0.0` - Automatic web driver management

### 3. Completely New Server Implementation
**Replaced Blender-specific functionality with desktop automation:**

#### Core Management Classes:
- **ApplicationManager**: Launch and control desktop applications
- **FileManager**: File operations (move, copy, organize)
- **WebManager**: Browser automation and web searching
- **SystemMonitor**: System resource monitoring

#### Available Tools:
1. **`open_application`** - Launch apps like Blender, VS Code, browsers, etc.
2. **`move_files`** - Move files and directories safely
3. **`copy_files`** - Copy files with path validation
4. **`list_directory_contents`** - Browse directory contents
5. **`search_web`** - Search using Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo
6. **`navigate_to_website`** - Open specific URLs
7. **`take_screenshot`** - Capture desktop screenshots
8. **`get_system_information`** - View CPU, memory, disk usage
9. **`get_running_processes`** - Monitor active processes
10. **`execute_command`** - Run system commands safely
11. **`close_browser`** - Clean up browser instances

### 4. Cross-Platform Support
**Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with platform-specific optimizations:**
- Windows: Native app launching, PowerShell/CMD support
- macOS: `open` command integration, native app support
- Linux: Desktop environment integration, package manager support

### 5. Safety Features
- Command timeouts (30 seconds)
- Path validation for file operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Browser instance cleanup
- Logging for debugging

### 6. Updated Documentation
- Complete README rewrite with usage examples
- Installation instructions for Claude Desktop and Cursor
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations

## Usage Examples

### Application Management
```
"Open Blender so I can start 3D modeling"
"Launch VS Code with my project directory"
"Start Chrome and navigate to GitHub"
```

### File Operations  
```
"Move all photos from Downloads to Pictures folder"
"Copy this project to my backup drive"
"Show me what's in my Documents directory"
```

### Web Automation
```
"Search Google for Python tutorials"
"Navigate to stackoverflow.com"
"Open YouTube and search for Blender tutorials"
```

### System Monitoring
```
"Show me my system performance"
"List programs using the most CPU"
"Take a desktop screenshot"
```

## What Was Removed
- Blender addon (`addon.py`)
- Blender-specific socket communication
- PolyHaven integration
- Sketchfab integration  
- Hyper3D Rodin integration
- Blender scene manipulation tools
- Asset download functionality

## Benefits of the Transformation
1. **Broader Utility**: Works with any desktop application, not just Blender
2. **Complete Automation**: File management, web browsing, system monitoring
3. **User-Friendly**: Natural language commands for common PC tasks
4. **Cross-Platform**: Single solution for Windows, macOS, and Linux
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new applications and capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Install using `uvx desktop-mcp` (when dependencies are available)
2. Configure in Claude Desktop or Cursor
3. Start automating your desktop tasks with AI assistance!

The Desktop MCP now serves as a comprehensive AI assistant for your entire computer, making it much more useful than the original Blender-specific version.
